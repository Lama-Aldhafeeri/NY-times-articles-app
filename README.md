The "NY Times Most Popular Articles" app is built with Flutter and follows the Clean Architecture pattern, which separates the code into layers for better maintainability and testability. The app's primary purpose is to fetch articles from an API that requires an API key. To maintain security, the API key is stored in a .env file, which is excluded from version control. Here's a brief overview of how the app works:

1. **Presentation Layer (lib/features/ny_times_articles/presentation/):**
- This layer handles the user interface and user interaction using Flutter widgets.
- Utilizes a FutureBuilder to display a list of all articles on the main page.
- Implements a navigation flow where tapping on an article navigates the user to a details screen.
- The details screen provides more information about the selected article.

2. **Domain Layer (lib/features/ny_times_articles/domain/):**
- Entities, representing core data models, are defined in this layer.
- Includes a "get articles" use case that encapsulates the business logic for retrieving articles.

3. **Data Layer (lib/features/ny_times_articles/data/):**
- Repositories in this layer implement the interfaces defined in the domain layer and interact with external data sources like APIs.
- Data sources, such as API services, are responsible for fetching data from external providers.
- The `Dio` package is used for making HTTP requests to the NY Times API.

4. **Testing:**
- Tests are performed using the `GetIt` service locator for dependency injection.
- Concrete implementations, like `FakeArticleRepository`, are registered with `GetIt` to provide test data directly.

5. **Dependencies (pubspec.yaml):**
- Dependencies are specified in the `pubspec.yaml` file, including external packages such as `Dio` for network requests, `Riverpod` for state management.
- Additionally, the `GetIt` package.


Overall, the app follows best practices for Flutter development, providing a structured and modular architecture that makes it easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
